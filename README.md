MOJO Coffee: 
Excellent   coffee   is   never   a   rational   thing; it's   a   drink   imbued   with   inspiration, freedom   ,   celebration, history, dreams   .   It's   about experience as   much as   refreshment.   It's
about personal space, about the pursuit of perfection, about   the   meeting   of   minds   ,   about escape and reward. That's the   Mojo and   it's   to treasure.
Founded as   a boutique roastery   café in Wellington by   Steve   and   Julie   Gianoutsos   in   2003,   Mojo   Coffee   is   now   one   of   New   Zealand’s   most   experienced   independent
coffee roasters   and café operators   . Starting from   humble beginnings   on Wakefield   Street,   Mojo has   grown like a family, working with passionate individuals   along the   way.   Mojo Coffee now   has   35 locations   across Auckland and Wellington.When   Covid-19 struck   in   2020 Mojo   Coffee   decided   to   make   their   locations   cash    free.    This   meant that they   no longer accepted cash for payments   and customers   pay   by   card or via the Mojo App.
Existing Mojo App Functionality: 
The Mojo App is   available on both Android and iOS.    All   registered   users   can   get
10% off   all   hot   drinks   and   freshly   roasted   coffee   beans   for   home,   every   visit. All   that is   required is to scan the   app at the till.   Other   handy   functions   on the   app   include
printing or emailing GST receipts   (this   is very   useful for customers   who are   claiming   their coffees   as   business   expenses), loading credit using your credit card and
tracking your transaction history.
This   case is   adapted from   information found on https://mojo.coffee/ but is fictitious   .
1 Using the information from the exam   case, suggest
a.   One   output   item   mentioned   that   has   been   historically   non-digital,   but   has   now   become “digital-first”   . Briefly   explain   your   answer.   [2]
b. One example of a TPS and one example of a   DSS   that   Mojo could   utilise   in the   process   of   generating   such   useful   information.   [2]

5 The Mojo   Team   is   looking to   enhance the functionality   of their   app   and   have   kicked off a   project   to   enable customers to pre-order their coffees   on the app.    The   idea   is   that   customers   place their orders   on   the   app   and   then, when   they   reach   the   store, they   scan   in, and   the   in-store   staff   start making thei代 写INFOSYS 110 Digital Systems (Exam) 2021 S2Java

The project manager estimates that this   project will take about   3   months   to   implement   and cost   Mojo   about   $50 000 in   one   off   costs   , and   about   $5 000   per   annum   in   ongoing   maintenance   costs   .   Mojo   is   estimating   a   10% increase   in   profit   per   annum   ,   because   of   this   initiative.
a. What makes this   a   project? State three   characteristics   about this   work   that   qualifies   it   as   a project rather than BAU   (Business   as   usual). Briefly   explain how   each   of the characteristics   apply.   [3]
b. What   is   the   time   constraint   in   this   project?      Be   specific   as   definitions   will   get   no   marks   .   [1]
c   . What   is   the   cost   constraint?      Be   specific   as   definitions   will   get   no   marks   .   [1]
2 months   into the project Julie Gianoutsos   points   out that   if the Mojo   app   could   utilise the   GPS
functionality   of modern phones to detect when the customers   are on the way to   the   store.      She suggests   modifying the app so that the barista gets   a notification to start   making the coffee when   a   customer   is   within   200   metres   of   the   store. 
d.   If   this   was   to   be   actioned, then   what   would   be   the   likely   impact   on   the   project   in   terms   of   the project   management   triangle?    Justify   your   answer.   [2]

6 Mojo has   decided to store all the ordering, payment and customer   data   utilised   by   the   app   on the   Amazon Cloud rather than storing them   on their own computers   .
a. Why   would   they   choose   to   do   that?   [1]
Mojo realise that if they   have access to their customers   ’ GPS data, they   could   send   alerts   with incentives for customers to pop in to their   stores   whenever   a   customer was   within   100   metres   of   the store.
b. They   are   wondering   if   this   is   ethical.    If   they   used   the “ rights   approach” ethical   framework   then how   would   you   advise   them?    Justify   your   answer.   [2]
One of the baristas   accessed the database to look   up a customer's   phone number to   ask   them   out   on   a   date.

7 A   part-time staff at Mojo   is   currently   an   INFOSYS110 student with   a   passion   in   computer
programming.   During quiet times   at work   , he contemplates   about the code required for   Mojo’s digital loyalty   programme, where patrons   get a free coffee after nine drinks   are   purchased   at   Mojo.   Being a beginner in coding, he came   up with   a   basic   idea where the   app   may   ask   a   customer the         following question: 
“ How   many   drink(s   ) have you purchased?”
Upon answering this   question by   inputting a numerical value, the app will process   this   data   and inform   the customer about whether they   are eligible for a free coffee, or how   many   more drink(s   )      they   have to purchase before   they   get a free one.   Responses from   the app   may   therefore   be   one   of   the   two   options   below:
“You   are   eligible   for   a   free   coffee!”
Or
“You   will   have   to   purchase   X   more   drink(s   ) to   get   your   free   coffee!” (where   X   is   the   number of   additional   drink(s   )   required).
To   facilitate   this   , the   following   JavaScript   code   is   proposed   (with   blanks   A   to   E):
var   cupsPurchased   =  (A)  ("How   many   drink(s   ) have   you   purchased?");  (B)  (cupsPurchased   <= 8) {
(C)  ("You   will   have   to   purchase   "  (D)  "   more   drink(s   )   to   get   your   free   coffee!")   }       else   {
(E)  ("You   are   eligible   for   a   free   coffee!")
}
Based   on   the   description   and   the   partial   code   above, fill   in   blanks   A   to   E.   [1   each]
